## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the historical price data of Bitcoin and gain insights into its price trends, volatility, and other patterns.
We aim to answer questions like how Bitcoin's price has changed over time, whether there are any noticeable trends, and how volatile the price movements have been.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Cufflinks

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Folder containing the Bitcoin price dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Source

The historical Bitcoin price data used in this analysis is obtained from [source link here]. 
The dataset includes features like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Market Cap.

## Data Preprocessing

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
3. Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format.
4. Calculated daily percentage changes in the closing price.

## Data Visualization

1. Created line plots to visualize the opening, closing, high, and low prices over time.
2. Plotted candlestick charts to visualize price ranges for specific time periods.
3. Analyzed closing price trends on both linear and logarithmic scales.
4. Resampled and visualized average closing prices on yearly, quarterly, and monthly bases.
5. Plotted daily percentage changes in closing prices.

## Analysis

The analysis provides insights into Bitcoin's price trends, seasonality, volatility, and overall performance over time.
Key observations include [mention some key findings here].

## Results

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that Bitcoin's price has shown [mention your conclusions here]. 
The visualizations help in understanding the price movements and patterns more effectively.

## Getting Started
